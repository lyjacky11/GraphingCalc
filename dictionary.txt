function
The function is a general relation between a set of input values (domain) and corresponding set of output values (co-domain). It relates each element of a set (domain) with exactly one element of another set (co-domain). Every element in domain must have a corresponding value in co-domain. A function is single valued. It can't give two or more output values for the same input.
polynomial
A polynomial function has the form, where are real numbers and n is a non negative integer. In other words, a polynomial is the sum of one or more monomials with real coefficients and non negative integer exponents. The degree of the polynomial function is the highest value for n where an is not equal to 0.
